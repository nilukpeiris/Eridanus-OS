I'm making a small mystery game for my friends. It's basically a dinner murder mystery game (without the murder).
The players find themselves in a ship on emergency mode. They are trying to figure out what happened. There's a lot of mystery around the circumstance. 
They will be able to access the emergency OS of the ship through this html and try to repair the ship.
